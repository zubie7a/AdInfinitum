#AdInfinitum

###Description
The AdInfinitum app is an application of the Cyclic Cellular Automaton theory, which from a initial state of several random dispersed colors, and a set of rules (colors converting a certain neighbors into their color) some linear patters start to emerge. This becomes even crazier if there's a 'random' element inserted into the chance of 'survival' of a color when being converted by another, breaking the linearity and creating spirals. This was done for educational purposes, using **SFML 2.0 in C++** and **AWT/Swing in Java**, and is licensed for use under the **MIT License**.

I installed **SFML** in **OSX** using [**brew**](http://brew.sh/). Get it. Its incredibly amazing and powerful.  
Just a *'$ brew install sfml'* will do it.

###Telling a story...
*A grid full of individual cells,  
each with a color value chosen at random,  
overall, there are up to 12 different colors*

*Suddenly, each cell becomes a prey.  
its hunter, is the 'next' color in the Metaverse rules, like:  
1 -> 2 / 2 -> 3 / 3 -> 4... up to 12 -> 1*  

*If everything goes according to the plan,  
a curious linear and cyclical pattern is formed*  

*But then, once in a while, chaos may appear.  
This chaos, is the uprising of the preys.  
It doesn't mean the prey will eat the hunter,  
but it means that a prey may survive. 50/50*  

*The linear cyclical pattern is broken, 
the result is a more organic and natural looking state*

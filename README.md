This was done with C++, using SFML 2.0, in XCode

-------

This is a 'port' of my old 'Ad Infinitum' application from Java to C++. The improvement in performance is… amazing. 

A grid full of individual cells
Each with a color value chosen at random
Overall, there are 12 different colors

Suddenly, each cell becomes a prey
Its hunter, is the 'next' color in the Metaverse rules
1 - 2 / 2 - 3 / 3 - 4 / 4 - 5 / 5 - 6 / 6 - 7 / 7 - 8 / 8 - 9 / 9 - 10 / 10 - 11 / 11 - 12 / 12 - 1

If everything goes according to the plan,
A curious linear and cyclical pattern is formed

But then, once in a while, chaos may appear
This chaos, is the uprising of the preys
It doesn't mean the prey will eat the hunter,
but it means that a prey may survive. 50/50

Linear cyclical pattern is broken, the result is a more organic and natural looking state
